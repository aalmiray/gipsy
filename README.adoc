Groovy version of https://github.com/kordamp/jipsy[Jipsy], a configurable AST Transformation to simplify the use of
the Service Provider Interface.

== Introduction

Gipsy delivers the same functionality that https://github.com/kordamp/jipsy[Jipsy] does but uses Groovy's AST Transformations
instead of JDK6' Annotation Processor.

As explained at the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service loader documentation],
services must follow certain rules in order to be considered as such; they also must be registered using an standard location
based on a naming convention. The following rules apply to classes that may be considered services

. The class must implement at least one target interface (the service interface).
. The class must provide a no-args constructor.
. The class must be public.
. The class name should be added to a file named `META-INF/services/<target_interface_name>`

This library provides a mechanism for enforcing those rules by simply adding an annotation on each service implementation, for
example say there exists the following `Calculator` service interface

[source,groovy]
----
package com.acme

interface Calculator {
    double add(double a, double b)
}
----

A basic implementation of such service may be as follows

[source,groovy]
----
package com.acme

@org.kordamp.jipsy.ServiceProviderFor(Calculator)
class BasicCalculator implements Calculator {
    double add(double a, double b) { a + b }
}
----

Notice that Gipsy reuses the same annotations from Jipsy. Compile your code. If you look closely at your
project's output you'll see a file named `META-INF/services/com.acme.Calculator` whose contents should look similar to

[source]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
# Generated by org.kordamp.gipsy.transform.service.ServiceProviderProcessor ({version})
# Wed, 25 Dec 2013 22:28:50 +0100
com.acme.BasicCalculator
----

Et voil√†! There are no additional sources to be touched nor files to be created; Jipsy will take care of the boiler plate.

== Installing

Gipsy requires the following dependencies

 - jipsy-{version}
 - groovy-all-2.5.6

Gipsy can be downloaded directly from https://bintray.com/kordamp/kordamp/gipsy[Bintray] or configure it via Maven or Gradle.

.Maven
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]

<dependency>
    <groupId>{project-group}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{project-name}</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    annotationProcessor '{project-group}:{project-name}:{version}'
    compileOnly '{project-group}:{project-name}:{version}'
}
